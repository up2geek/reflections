When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you might be working from a different computer or working with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because someone else might be working within the same repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are only available on github and not git alone. used to create a 
    clone of someone else's repository onto your github.
    
    clones are used to create local copies from a remote or a remote copy
    from a local copy.
    
    Branches can exist in all of these. A fork is similar to a branch, but
    more like a internal github clone.
    
    Branches are for veering off the master path to experiment or assign
    branches to contributors.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
